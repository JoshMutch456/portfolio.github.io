        <p class="headerDesc1" id="headerDesc"> I’m a passionate Games Programmer with hands-on experience in C#, C++, and modern game engines including Unity and Unreal Engine. 
          I specialize in building clean and polished games and translating creative ideas into engaging, responsive gameplay experiences.
          I thrive in collaborative team environments where communication, iteration, and shared problem-solving drive projects forward. Whether working alongside designers, artists, 
          or fellow programmers, I value clarity, adaptability, and a strong team-first mindset to deliver polished, high-quality results.
          Beyond the technical side, I genuinely love video games. I’m fascinated by how mechanics, systems, and storytelling come together to create meaningful player experiences.

          without dropping the balls down the gap. This project is made with C# and unity by utilizing a 2D environment and spinning objects to move the objects around
          and touch screen controlls for mobile usage of the pinball arms.</p>
